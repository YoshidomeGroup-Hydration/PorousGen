# [PorousGen] GitHub Repository
“PorousGen” allows for the efficient generation of large-scale porous structures through parallel computation. 
It can also accurately create structures according to a defined target porosity.
This repository contains all data and code used in the manuscript, as well as the implementation of the proposed algorithm.  
The folder structure is organized according to the sections of the manuscript.

## Usage

### Reproducing Figures and Tables
1. Navigate to the corresponding code folder for the figure or table you want to reproduce.
2. Run the Python script.

Example:
```bash
cd code/section3_1_1_l
python param_l_analysis.py

# Usage

## Test Parameters

The following parameters are used for test execution:

```text
# --- Parameter Settings ---
VN_ori = 200        # N_Box
VL_ori = 10         # L_Box [nm]
ran = 1             # seed
mean = 140          # D_Mean [nm]
stan = 1            # D_SD [nm]
eta_target = 40     # \eta_Box [%]
delta_VN = 50       # l = VL_ori * delta_VN [\mu m]
N = 5               # The box is divided into N^3 subdomains for parallel computation.
eta_err = 1         # \eta_Err [%]
phi_particle = 50   # \phi_Particle [%]
dL2 = mean + 2*stan # 2dL [nm]
```

A 3D porous structure with 100^3 voxels of size 20 nm is generated.
TIFF images of the structure will be output.
